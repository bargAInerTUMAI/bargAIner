Seller:
So, for the full migration and support after go-live, our fixed price would be €1.15 million.

Buyer (Procurement):
Okay. That’s higher than I expected. Can you explain what’s driving that number?

Seller:
Mainly the number of systems, testing, and having senior people on the project.

[AI pulls up maximum of 900k]

Buyer:
I understand that but I am sorry our internal policies forbid me to go higher than 900k. this is the absolute lowest I can go.
